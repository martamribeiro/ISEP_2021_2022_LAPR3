# US 303 - Get closeness locals by continent

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Traffic manager I wish to know which places (cities or ports) are closest to all other places (closeness places).

### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* Return the n closeness locals by continent
* The measure of proximity is calculated as the average of the shortest path
  length from the local to all other locals in the network

**From the client clarifications:**

>Q1: In US303 we should return the n closest locals by continent, but should we calculate the closest locals by comparing them with locals from all over the world or just from their respective continent?
>
>A2: Should only consider the locations of the continent.

# 4. Tests

### FreightNetwork class

**Test 1** Check if existent continents of a locations freight network are obtained correctly.

**Test 2** Check if subgraph of a continent is obtained correctly.

**Test 3** Check if values of closeness are correct.

**Test 4** Check if closeness sort order is correct by continent
