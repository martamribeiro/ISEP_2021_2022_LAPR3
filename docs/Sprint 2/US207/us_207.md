# US 207 -As Ship Captain, I want to know how many cargo manifests I have transported during a given year and the average number of containers per manifest.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As **Ship Captain**, I want to know how many **cargo manifests** I have transported during a given year and the **average number of containers** per manifest.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>The system is to be used by the following people:
> 
> ...
> 
> Ship captain â€“ someone who oversees ship operations

>Each time a ship docks at a port or a truck arrives at a location, an Unloading Cargo Manifest is
delivered to the operations team at the port or warehouse and at the end of operations a Loading
Cargo Manifest is delivered to the ship crew. The same is true for trucks. The Cargo Manifest only has
the necessary information about the containers that are being loaded and unloaded.

**From the client clarifications:**

>Q1: How shold the ship be selected, from MMSI code, name or IMO?
>
>A2: Any of them.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Only the cargo manifests of the specified year are considered.
* **AC2:** Average containers per cargo manifest are properly computed.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency with the existence of the cargo manifest and container classes, and also with US111: "As Project Manager, I want the team to create a SQL script to load the database
with a minimum set of data sufficient to carry out data integrity verification and functional testing".

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input data:**
The year to search for cargo manifests.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Ship
* CargoManifest
* Container

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ShipStoreDatabase
* App

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXX-SD](US_207_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

###4.1 Controller class tests:
**Test 1:** Check if the integration of the functionality works as expected
