# 4. Tests

### ShipStoreDB

Tests to ensure getIdleShips() is functioning correctly.

**Test 1:** Check if beginning of the year is correctly computed in the method

**Test 2:** Check if it returns the ships and their idle days correctly

Similar logic must be applied to getIdleShipes() in GetIdleShipsController Class.
