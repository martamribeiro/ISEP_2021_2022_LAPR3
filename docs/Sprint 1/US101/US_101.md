# US_101 - to import ships from a text file into a BST

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a traffic manager, I wish to import ships from a text file into a BST

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> Ships are characterized by:
>- MMSI
>- Ship name
>- IMO
> 
>  [...]
>- Call Sign
>- Vessel type
> 
>  [...]
>- Draft
>
>  [...]
>- Position
> 
>  [...]


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** ....?
>
> **Answer:** ......

>Read the whole answer [here](.....).

>Read the whole answer [here](.....).


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** no data lost
* **AC2:** "MMSI: unique 9-digit ship identification number"
* **AC3:** "IMO: unique 7-digit international identification number."
* **AC4:** Latitude: between -90 and 90 degrees. 91 in case of "not available".
* **AC4:** Longitude: between -180 and 180 degrees. 181 in case of "not available".


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to "US...: ..............." since .............


### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * text file path

* Selected data:
    * n/a


**Output Data:**

* operation success/failure


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

The present US isn't held many times during the business. As the business grows, the company might import new ships to the software system, but probably these ships won't be added individually and will only be added once in a large amount of time.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: asks to import ships from a text file into a BST | ... interacting with the actor? | ImportShipsUI | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| Step 2: asks for data(i.e., file path) | ... asking the actor for this data? | ImportShipsUI | IE: Responsible for user interaction. |
| Step 3: types requested data | ... receiving inserted data | ImportShipsUI | IE: Responsible for user interaction. |
| | ... coordinating the US? | ImportShipsController | IE: It refers to the Controller. There is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| | ... knowing if the given Ship exists? | ShipsBST | IE: owns its data |
| | ... knowing the ShipsBST? | Company | Company knows the ShipsBST |
| | ... knowing if the given Vessel Type exists? | VesselTypeStore | IE: owns its data |
| | ... knowing the VesselTypeStore? | Company | Company knows the VesselTypeStore |
| | ... instancing a new Vessel Type? (if needed) | VesselTypeStore | Creator |
| | ... validating the data locally? | VesselType | IE: knows its own data |
| | ... validating the data globally? | VesselTypeBST | IE: knows all the VesselType objects |
| | ... saving the created Vessel Type? | VesselTypeBST | IE: adopts/records all the Vessel Type objects |
| | ... instancing a new Ship? (if needed) | ShipsBST | Creator |
| | ... validating the data locally? | Ship | IE: knows its own data |
| | ... validating the data globally? | ShipsBST | IE: knows all the Ship objects |
| | ... saving the created Ship? | ShipsBST | IE: adopts/records all the Ship objects |
| | ... knowing if the given Position exists? | PositionBST | IE: owns its data |
| | ... knowing the PositionBST? | Ship | Ship knows the PositionBST |
| | ... instancing a new position? | PositionBST | Creator |
| | ... validating the data locally? | Position | IE: knows its own data |
| | ... validating the data globally? | PositionBST | IE: knows all the Ship objects |
| | ... saving the created Position? | PositionBST | IE: adopts/records all the Position objects |
| Step 4: informs of operation success or fail | ... informing operation success? | ImportShipsUI | IE: is responsible for user interactions. |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* ShipsBST
* Ship
* PositionBST
* Position
* VesselTypeStore
* VesselType

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ImportShipsUI
* ImportShipsController
