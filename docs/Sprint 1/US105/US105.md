### 3.1. Rationale


| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | TopNUI  |
| 			  	 |	... coordinating the US? | TopNController | Controller                             |
| 	Step 2		  	 |   |   |  |
|   Step 3 		 |	...saving the inputted data? | ShipStore | IE: ShipStore uses data.  | 
|  	Step 4	 |	...return list of ships?  | ShipStore| ShipStore gathers the ship's info accordingly with the initial and final Base Date Time.|

# 4. Tests

**ShipBSTTest**

     @Test
    public void getAllShipsNoDuplicates() {
        *add all ships created to a List*

        *assert using getAllShips*
    }
* Test 1: ensure all the ships in the BST are added to a List without duplicates.


    @Test
    public void mapOrderedByTravelledDistance() {
        *add ship's Travelled Distance, Delta Distance and Total Movements to different LinkedHashSets*
        *associate each Set to a Ship MMSI in a LinkedHashMap*

        *assert using sortedByTravelledDistance()*
    }
* Test 2: ensure every Ship's Travelled Distance, Delta Distance and Total Movements are associated with it's MMSI and ordered by Travelled Distance (descending)


     @Test
    public void mapOrderedByMovements() {
        *add ship's Travelled Distance, Delta Distance and Total Movements to different LinkedHashSets*
        *associate each Set to a Ship MMSI in a LinkedHashMap*

        *assert using sortedByTotalMovements()*
    }
* Test 3: ensure every Ship's Travelled Distance, Delta Distance and Total Movements are associated with it's MMSI and ordered by Total Movements (ascending)
